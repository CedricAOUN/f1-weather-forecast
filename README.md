## F1 weather forecast app

Front-end only app made to automatically determine the weather at formula 1 tracks, at the time of every F1 session. It manages 2 APIs (Formula 1 API, Weather API), and ties them together for a cohesive user experience using tailwind. Plenty of date management with the date-fns library, a countdown till the next F1 session, session live status management, and an embeded weather radar with the exact location of every available track per F1 season.
